<p><b>A paragraph is a collection of words combined together to make a longer unit than a 
sentence.<b/></p> <p><i>It's a set of sentences that are well-organized and coherent, and they're 
all about the same thing.</i></p> <p><strong>Several sentences often make up a paragraph. There are normally 
three to eight sentences in a paragraph.</strong></p> <em>Almost all of the writing one reads in a textbook
or an article can be grouped into paragraphs if it is longer than a few sentences</em>.
